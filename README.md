# About
Happened to discover the <a href="https://developer.marvel.com" target="_blank">Marvel Comics API</a> which fuelled my desire to constantly push the way I work, discover new principles and develop new ideas.

# Installation
Create an Marvel API account, paste in private_key & public_key in sdmAPI.swift
